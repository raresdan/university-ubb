# Ortho-Vision Project

Ortho-Vision is an AI-powered dental application designed to assist dentists in planning optimal therapeutic implant treatments. By leveraging advanced deep learning models for segmentation and object detection, the app analyzes dental radiographs to identify dental structures and anomalies, providing interactive reports and improving the dental implant planning process.

## üìñ **Introduction**

Ortho-Vision aims to improve dental implant planning by providing a user-friendly AI-based tool that can segment dental features from radiographs, detect anomalies, and generate interactive reports for dentists. The primary goal is to assist in identifying key dental structures necessary for accurate implant placement.

## üíª **Project Overview**

The project follows a multi-phase approach to develop a robust dental application:

1. **Segmentation Models**: Identifying key dental features in radiographs. This was done foer experimentation purposes, but the model for segmentation is not part of the final application
2. **Object Detection Models**: Detecting anomalies and identifying individual teeth.
3. **Model Improvements**: Enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the AI models.
4. **Integration**: Building a complete web application with a user-friendly interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Application Functionality**

The application includes the following functionalities:

- Upload dental radiographs.
- Detect anomalies in the dental images.
- Identify individual teeth and match them with corresponding anomalies.
- Generate interactive reports for dentists.
- Allow editing of the AI-generated reports to improve accuracy.
