Packet Tracer Example

Network IP: 128.163.252.0
Mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24)
x = 32 - 24 = 8 => 2^8 = 256 IP Addresses

Sub networks:
N1: 48 IP's
N2: 52 IP's
N3: 12 IP's
N4: 16 IP's
N5: 4 IP's

We also need:
N12345:  5 IP's
N5w: 2 IP's

n devices (IP) + 1 router + 1 NA + 1 BA => n+3
* N1: 48 + 3 = 51 < 64 = 2^6 => /26
* N2: 52 + 3 = 55 < 64 = 2^6 => /26
* N3: 12 + 3 = 15 < 16 = 2^4 => /28
* N4: 16 + 3 = 19 < 32 = 2^5 => /27
* N5: 4 + 3 = 7 < 8 = 2^3 => /29
* N12345: 5 + 2 = 7 < 8 = 2^3 => /29
* N5w: 2 + 2 = 4 < 4 = 2^2 => /30

64 + 64 + 16 + 32 + 8 + 8 + 4 = 196 < 256

Enumerating the networks:
* N1 = 128.163.252.0  /26		R1=.1   S1=.2  
* N2 = 128.163.252.64 /26		R2=.65  SWEB=.66
* N3 = 128.163.252.128/28 		R3=.129 SDNS=.130
* N4 = 128.163.252.144/27		R4=.145
* N5 = 128.163.252.176/29		R5=.177
* N12345 = 128.163.252.184/29		R1=.185 R2=.186 R3=.187 R4=.188 R5=.189
* N5w = 128.163.252.192 /30		R5=.193 Rw=.194

Netmasks:
/24 => 255.255.255.0
/25 => 255.255.255.128
/26 => 255.255.255.192
/27 => 255.255.255.224
/28 => 255.255.255.240
/29 => 255.255.255.248
/30 => 255.255.255.252

EXPLANATIONS (STEPS)
- Routers (Router-PT-Empty):
	1. Stop the router
	2. Add 4 CFE boards
	* Can config just one router than copy-paste
	* Take it one at a time
	* Link N to R using FastEthernet0/0
- Link end-devices and severs to switch and to router usinf 'Copper Straight-Through'
- Router -> Config -> Turn ON -> Complete IP & Mask
- Server -> Desktop -> IP Configuration -> Static -> Complete IP & Mask, Default Gateway (Router's IP), DNS -> Services -> DHCP -> ON -> Start IP Adresses serverIP + 1, Default Gateway, DNS -> SAVE!
- PC -> Desktop -> DHCP
- Server WEB - DO SAME AS SERVER + Services -> HTTP -> Edit Index.html -> Desktop -> Web Browser -> URL = Server IP
- Server DNS - DO SAME AS SERVER + Services + DNS + ON + Set a name(whatever) + Set address of WEB server + ADD!
- If PCs don't have a server -> set static IP (Router IP + 1)
	// OR Config Router as DHCP: CLI -> enable -> configure t -> ip dhcp pool x -> network IP NETMASK -> default-router Router IP -> dns-server DNS IP -> CTRL+Z -> write memory
- Laptops -> Turn off -> Remove default board -> Add WPC board -> Turn ON -> Wireless -> SSID Name -> SET DHCP
- Access point -> config -> Port1 -> set SSID NAME
- Wireless router is connected with 'Cross-Over' cable (INTERNET -> Avaliable port) -> Config -> Static - Complete all fields -> Wireless -> Rename (PCs need to be linked with 'Copper Straight-Through')
- Smartphone -> Config -> Wirless -> Set name of wireless connection -> DHCP (MUST HAVE OUR DNS)

Routing Tables
Config -> Static Routing -> Details (Network = Nx IP, Mask = Associated Mask, Next HOP = linked component IP) -> Add
R1 to: R2, R3, R4, R5, Rw
ALL to ALL

TEST
R1 -> PC -> Desktop -> Comand Prompt -> ping x.x.x.WEB; ping x.x.x.DNS -> browser -> domain.com
