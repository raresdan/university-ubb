        <p><b>Vikings</b> were seafaring people originally from Scandinavia (present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden),
            who from the late 8th to the late 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded, and settled throughout parts of Europe.
            They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, Greenland, and Vinland 
            (present-day Newfoundland in Canada, North America). 
            In their countries of origin, and some of the countries they raided and settled in, 
            this period is popularly known as the Viking Age, and the term "Viking" also commonly 
            includes the inhabitants of the Scandinavian homelands as a whole. The Vikings had a profound 
            impact on the early medieval history of Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Estonia, and Kievan Rus'.</p>

            <p> <b> Odin - Father of Gods </b> </p>
            <p> Odin was the great magician among the gods and was associated with runes. 
                He was also the god of poets. In outward appearance he was a tall, old man, with flowing beard and only one eye. 
                He was usually depicted wearing a cloak and a wide-brimmed hat and carrying a spear.</p>

            <p> <b>Goofs</b> </p>
            <p>Most historian hold it very likely that the Norse had contact with the Anglo-Saxons in the later part of the 8th century and the existence of England was widely known to them, unlike how they are portrayed in this show. Contact and trade with Anglo-Saxons is actually a likely explanation for the Vikings ability to locate monasteries such as Lindisfarne.</p>
